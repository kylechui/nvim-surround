## :sparkles: Features

* Add/change/remove surrounding pairs and HTML tags
  * Change *only* the surrounding HTML tag's element type, and leave its
    attributes
* Dot-repeat previous actions
* Set buffer-local mappings and surrounds
* Surround using powerful pairs that depend on user input
* Jump to the *nearest* surrounding pair for modification
* Use a single character as an alias for several text-objects
  * E.g. `q` is aliased to <code>\`,',"</code>, so <code>csqb</code> replaces
    the *nearest* set of quotes with parentheses
* Highlight the section that you are about to surround, as a visual indicator

## :package: Installation

### [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use({
    "kylechui/nvim-surround",
    config = function()
        require("nvim-surround").setup({
            -- Configuration here, or leave empty to use defaults
        })
    end
})
```

## :rocket: Usage

### The Basics

This plugin serves to help you accomplish three common actions quickly and
efficiently:

* Surrounding some selection with a left and right delimiter
* Deleting the surrounding delimiter pair (around the cursor)
* Changing the surrounding delimiter pair (around the cursor) to another pair

The following examples are all run from Normal mode, unless otherwise specified.

#### Adding New Surrounds

By default, adding new surrounds is done by the keymap prefix `ys`, which can be
thought of as meaning "you surround". It is used via `ys[object][char]`, where
`object` denotes the
[text-object](https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#object-select) that you are
surrounding with a delimiter pair defined by `char`. Consider the example
buffer:

```lua
local str = "This is a sentence"
```

If the cursor is on the `T` and you press `ysiw'`, then "you surround inner word
with single quotes", yielding:

```lua
local str = "'This' is a sentence"
```

From here, typing `ysa")` means "you surround around double quotes with
parentheses", yielding:

```lua
local str = ("'This' is a sentence")
```

Surrounds can also be added by first selecting the text *in Visual mode*, then
pressing `S[char]`, e.g. `VS]`.

#### Deleting Surrounds

By default, deleting surrounding pairs is done by the keymap prefix `ds`, which
can be thought of as meaning "delete surround". It is used via `ds[char]`, where
`char` refers to the pair to be deleted. Consider the example buffer:

```lua
require("nvim-surround").setup()
```

If the cursor is on the `-` and you press `ds"`, then you "delete surrounding
double quotes", yielding:

```lua
require(nvim-surround).setup()
```

From here, typing `ds(` means "delete surrounding parentheses", yielding:

```lua
requirenvim-surround.setup()
```

#### Changing Surrounds

By default, changing surrounding pairs is done by the keymap prefix `cs`, which
can be thought of as meaning "change surround". It is used via
`cs[char1][char2]`, where `char1` refers to the pair to be deleted, and `char2`
represents the pair to replace it. Consider the example buffer:

```lua
local tab = { 'Just', (some), "strings" }
```

If the cursor is on the `J` and you press `cs'"`, then you "change surrounding
single quotes to double quotes", yielding:

```lua
local tab = { "Just", (some), "strings" }
```

From here, typing `cs("` means "change surrounding parentheses to double
quotes", yielding:

```lua
local tab = { "Just", "some", "strings" }
```

> **Note**: If there are no pairs that are immediately surrounding the cursor, it
> can *jump* to the "nearest pair" (forwards or backwards). See `:h
> nvim-surround.jump` for more details.

## :gear: Configuration

### The Basics

All delimiter keys should be one character *exactly*, and *unique*. In the
`delimiters` table, each value is either a pair of strings, representing the
left and right surrounding pair, or a function returning a pair of strings.
Multi-line strings are represented by tables of strings, with each string
representing a new line.

### Modifying Defaults

To change a preset, give the corresponding key a new value. To disable any
functionality, simply set the corresponding key's value to `false`. For example,

```lua
require("nvim-surround").setup({
    delimiters = {
        pairs = { -- Remaps "a" and "b"
            ["a"] = {
                { "this", "has", "several", "lines" },
                "single line",
            },
            ["b"] = function()
                return {
                    "hello",
                    "world",
                }
            end,
        },
        HTML = { -- Disables HTML-style mappings
            ["t"] = false,
            ["T"] = false,
        },
    },
    highlight_motion = { -- Disables highlights
        duration = false,
    },
})
```

For buffer-local configurations, just call
`require("nvim-surround").buffer_setup` for any buffer that you would like to
configure. This can be especially useful for setting filetype-specific surrounds
by calling `buffer_setup` inside `ftplugin/[filetype].lua`.

nvim-surround`](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/blob/main/doc/nvim-surround.txt),
